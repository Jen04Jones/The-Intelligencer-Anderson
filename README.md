# The-Intelligencer-Anderson

This is a scrapping of The Anderson intelligencer From LOC Chronicling America.

My purpose in creating this dataset is to scrap the Anderson specific newspaper to tie in the connections of Clemson University Textile Department, Textile Mills, and the growing economy
during 1860-1914. There is a close tie between the university and the textile industries development in some ways they are the reason for growth in Anderson County. I have created
a data-set that has the date, and name of the newspaper, with the OCRed Text of Articles concerning Textiles. I had to first scrap the OCR text, and then clean it enough that it
is readable. Right now it only has the artcle split by date. But it shows Anderson growth and the beginnings of Textiles in Anderson and the beginning of Clemson Agricultural College.

AI Citations
For this project I used AI Copilot to help with cleaning blocks of text and some debugging. I will cite next 
to the code that I got help on.
