# The-Intelligencer-Anderson

This is a two part scrapping and Cleaning of The Anderson intelligencer From LOC Chronicling America.
It contains a scrapping to get the raw data from the newspaper, and a csv file to clean. The second
scrapper is to help clean the data some, before formatting into an excel file for easier reading. The
excel file is in the repository to review and for research use on the connections of Clemson Agricultural
College, Anderson County, and Textile Industry to local economy.
